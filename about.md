## About Me

I am an MS Robotics student at **Northwestern University**, focused on robot perception, manipulation, and legged locomotion. Before joining Northwestern, I spent five years as a Modelling & Simulation Engineer at **Daimler Trucks**, where I developed powertrain digital twins, state estimators, and ML-based fault detection for EV platforms. My current work spans sim-to-real reinforcement learning for quadruped locomotion, vision-guided manipulation with foundation models, and SLAM — with a broader interest in building robots that reliably operate in unstructured environments.
